It's not feasible to\nre-architect your real system often, and certainly not in a single day, or is\nit? This brand new workshop from the author of Building Microservices gives\nyou a safe space to explore ideas behind microservice architectures with peers\nfrom other organisations.</p>\n<p>In this workshop, we'll share some framing for micro service architectures\nthat explore the various forces that can drive the design and evolution of\nmicroservices, and then you'll participate in a series of interactive\narchitectural kata exercises to put your new found knowledge to the test.\nAfterwards, you'll have a series of tools to take back to your own\norganisations to put into practice.</p>\n<h1>What you'll learn</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes a good microservice</li>\n<li>How to use concepts from domain driven design to define service boundaries</li>\n<li>Explore how to plan and manage a migration from a monolith to the\nmicroservice architecture</li>\n<li>Understand how technical choices can impact the architecture itself</li>\n<li>How to manage change and governance in a microservice environment</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>About Sam Newman</h1>\n<p>Sam Newman is an author, speaker, and independent consultant interested in\ncloud, continuous delivery and microservices.

# Collaborative Research for Better Design Decisions

This workshop will help you identify the information you need and facilitate evidence-based design decisions. Many teams still make design decisions based on speculation or personal preference because they are asking the wrong questions or looking at the wrong data. You need to start with shared goals and a clear process in order to end up with useful insights.

We'll cover the fundamentals of the research process as well as how to communicate with clients, stakeholders, and partners across disciplines. 

Everyone will walk away at the end of the day with ideas and practices they can use immediately.

# You'll learn how to

- Identify the most critical questions to decrease risk and increase success
- Choose methods and activities based on your goals, timeframe, and budget
- Use qualitative and quantitative data together
- Master the art of the interview
- Think as a team to get the best insights from your data
- Digest, report, and share insights so that none get lost or go to waste
- Cultivate practical curiosity and continue learning over time
